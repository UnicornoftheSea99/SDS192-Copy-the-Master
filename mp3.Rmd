## Our Approach

The goal of this project was to mimic the data graphic from the Flowing Data post by finding and then plotting the most unisex names (meaning equally assigned to female and male babies) found in the babynames package. A general strategy we employed was to go through the Jessie start code line by line to figure out what each part was doing, which helped us successfully generalize it later.

To start, we found the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the name "Jessie". Then, to find the RMSE for all names, we first considered how we could make the data from the babynames package more manageable. First, we filtered by the years in between 1930 and 2012 and then removed rows in which there was a NA value (meaning that the name was not assigned to either males or females.) We also reshaped the data by applying pivot_wider.  After altering the data, we created a function called find_rmse that adds columns error and squared error and then summarizes that data to give the mean squared error (mse) and root mean squared error (rmse). We then applied this function to the altered data, called all_babies, that we grouped by name. 

We tried various things when filtering to get the top 35 most unisex names: filtering out names with NA in the M or F column, finding the total occurrences of each name and considering the most popular names, and finding the total years in which each name appeared and including names that occurred in at least 70 years. We were not entirely successful at matching the original data graphic. 

To gather the data for the time series, we filtered the original babynames data frame to include only the years of interest. We rearranged and mutated the data based on the “Jessie” plot code. To limit the names included to only the top 35 most unisex ones, we did an inner join between our modified babynames data frame and the data frame we created earlier with the 35 most unisex names. 

To draw the points representing the most unisex years, we started with the code to draw the point for the name “Jessie” and wrote a function to generalize the process. Then we used map_dfr() to iterate those steps over the list of the top 35 most unisex names. 

To create the annotations for the exhibit, we used the tribble() or transposed tibble command to manually create the descriptions for each notable name trend. This enabled us to construct a new data frame in which each row corresponds to a single segment, such as the year and the composition of boys to girls ratio. 

Finally, to draw the plot, we used a combination of the line, area, point, path, and text geoms. We mimicked a lot of elements from the sample Jessie plot, including the fill and scale of the y axis, but changed other elements including but not limited to adding a facet wrap based on name and adding annotations with segments to the plots of certain names.

## Step 1: Make the plot for "Jessie"

### Step 1A: Gather the data for "Jessie"

```{r jessie-data}
jessie <- babynames %>%
  filter(
    name == "Jessie", 
    year >= 1930 & year < 2012
  ) %>%
  select(-prop) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(pct_girls = F / (F + M))
jessie
```

### Step 1B: Compute the "most unisex year"

```{r jessie-year}
jessie_unisex_year <- jessie %>%
  mutate(distance = abs(pct_girls - 0.5)) %>%
  arrange(distance) %>%
  head(1)
jessie_unisex_year
```


### Step 1C: Add the annotations for "Jessie"

```{r jessie-context}
jessie_context <- tribble(
  ~year_label, ~vpos, ~hjust, ~name, ~text,
  1934, 0.35, "left", "Jessie", "Most\nunisex year"
)

jessie_segments <- tribble(
  ~year, ~pct_girls, ~name,
  1940, 0.43, "Jessie",
  1940, 0.5, "Jessie",
  1949, 0.4956897, "Jessie"
)

jessie_labels <- tribble(
  ~year, ~name, ~pct_girls, ~label,
  1998, "Jessie", 0.8, "BOYS",
  1998, "Jessie", 0.2, "GIRLS"
)
```

### Step 1D: Draw the plot for "Jessie"

```{r jessie-plot}
ggplot(jessie, aes(x = year, y = pct_girls)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(fill = "#eaac9e") +
  geom_point(data = jessie_unisex_year, fill = "white", pch = 21, size = 3) +
  geom_path(data = jessie_segments) +
  geom_text(
    data = jessie_labels, 
    aes(label = label), 
    color = "white"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = jessie_context, family = "Century Gothic",
    aes(x = year_label, y = vpos, label = text, hjust = hjust), vjust = "top"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, 
    limits = c(0, 1),
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    labels = scales::percent, 
    expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1940, 1960, 1980, 2000), 
                     labels = c("1940", "'60", "'80", "2000"), 
                     expand = c(0,0), 
                     NULL) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#eaac9e", "black")) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#92bdd3"),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
#    text = element_text(family = "Century Gothic"),
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "bold", size = 14)
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "1. Jessie", 
    caption = "Source: Social Security Administration | By http://flowingdata.com"
  )
```

## Step 2: Make the graphic for all 35 names

Make [the full data graphic](https://i2.wp.com/flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/most-unisex-names2.png?w=2000) with the 35 most gender-neutral names:

![](https://i2.wp.com/flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/most-unisex-names2.png?w=2000)

Or at least, make an attempt that's as good as mine:

![](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/gfx/my_babynames.png)


This bit of code will create a data frame with the 35 names as ranked by FlowingData.com. You can use this to check your work, but note that to meet the standard for *computing* the names, you need to discover these names algorithmically. 

```{r}
fd_names <- c(
  "Jessie", "Marion", "Jackie", "Alva", "Ollie",
  "Jody", "Cleo", "Kerry", "Frankie", "Guadalupe",
  "Carey", "Tommie", "Angel", "Hollis", "Sammie",
  "Jamie", "Kris", "Robbie", "Tracy", "Merrill",
  "Noel", "Rene", "Johnnie", "Ariel", "Jan",
  "Devon", "Cruz", "Michel", "Gale", "Robin",
  "Dorian", "Casey", "Dana", "Kim", "Shannon"
) %>%
  enframe(name = "fd_rank", value = "name")
```

### Step 2A: Compute the RMSE for Jessie

```{r}
jessie %>%
  mutate(
    error = pct_girls - 0.5,
    squared_error = error^2
  ) %>%
  summarize(
    mse = mean(squared_error),
    rmse = sqrt(mse)
  )
```

### Step 2B: Compute the RMSE for all names

```{r}
#collect all baby data, filter and reshape it
all_babies <- babynames %>%
  filter( year >= 1930 & year < 2012) %>%
  select(-prop) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>%
   mutate(
  pct_girls = F / (F + M))%>%
  filter(!is.na(F) & !is.na(M)) 
```

```{r}
find_rmse <- function(x) {
  x %>%
    mutate(
           error = pct_girls - 0.5,
           squared_error = error^2
    ) %>%
    summarize(
      mse = mean(squared_error),
      rmse = sqrt(mse)
    )
}

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
all_babies %>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  group_modify(~find_rmse(.x))
```


### Step 2C: Rank and filter the list of names
```{r}
#finds 1000 most popular names
popular_names <- all_babies %>%
  #filter(pct_girls>=0.25, pct_girls<=0.75)%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  summarize(
    #avg_pct_girls = mean(pct_girls),
    total_years = n(),
    total_occurences = sum(F+M)
  ) %>%
  filter(total_years >= 70 & name != "Unknown")%>%
  #filter(avg_pct_girls>=0.3, avg_pct_girls<=0.7) #%>%
  arrange(desc(total_occurences))%>%
 head(1000)

pop_rmse <- all_babies%>%
  inner_join(popular_names, by = "name")

most_unisex_names <- pop_rmse %>%
#  head(1000)%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  group_modify(~find_rmse(.x))%>%
  arrange((rmse))%>%
  head(35)
```


### Step 2D: Gather the data you need to draw the time series
```{r, eval = TRUE}
data <- babynames %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1930 & year < 2012
  ) %>%
  select(-prop) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(pct_girls = F / (F + M)) %>%
  inner_join(most_unisex_names, by = c("name" = "name"))
dim(data)

```

### Step 2E: Gather the data you need to draw the points
Goal: generalize the pattern you used in Step 1B to compute the most unisex year for each of the 35 names. Again, you can do this by either mapping a function or by joining.


```{r}
most_unisex_yr <- function(name_arg) {
  all_babies %>%
    filter(name == name_arg) %>%
    mutate(distance = abs(pct_girls - 0.5)) %>%
    arrange(distance) %>%
    head(1)
}

names_list <- most_unisex_names %>% 
  select(-mse, -rmse) %>%
  deframe()
  
unisex_years <- map_dfr(names_list, most_unisex_yr) 

unisex_years
```

### Step 2F: Polish the data
```{r}
# remove unknown 
all_babies <- all_babies %>% filter(name != "Unknown")

#repeat from above 
most_unisex_yr <- function(name_arg) {
  all_babies %>%
    filter(name == name_arg) %>%
    mutate(distance = abs(pct_girls - 0.5)) %>%
    arrange(distance) %>%
    head(1)
}

names_list <- most_unisex_names %>% 
  select(-mse, -rmse) %>%
  deframe()
  
unisex_years <- map_dfr(names_list, most_unisex_yr) 

unisex_years
```

### Step 2G: Create the annotations

```{r}
map_dfr(c("Jessie", "Marion", "Jackie", "Ariel", "Jamie"), most_unisex_yr)

general_context <- tribble(
  ~year_label, ~vpos, ~hjust, ~name, ~text,
  1934, 0.35, "left", "Jessie", "Most\nunisex year",
  1977, 0.35, "right", "Marion", "Marion Jones wins\ngold in Olympics", 
  2006, 0.35, "top", "Jackie", "Jackie Robinson to\nmajor league", 
  1930, 0.35, "right", "Ariel", "The Little Mermaid\nsways Ariel towards girls",
  1936, 0.35, "top", "Jamie", "Jamie Hunter Cartwright\nappears on Bonanza"
)

general_segments <- tribble(
  ~year, ~pct_girls, ~name, 
  1940, 0.43, "Jessie",
  1940, 0.5, "Jessie",
  1949, 0.4956897, "Jessie",
  1940, 0.23, "Marion",
  1940, 0.5, "Marion", 
  1977, 0.5, "Marion", 
  1980, 0.33, "Jackie",
  1980, 0.498, "Jackie",
  2006, 0.498, "Jackie",
  1923, 0.23, "Ariel",
  1923, 0.498, "Ariel",
  1930, 0.498, "Ariel",
  1928, 0.23, "Jamie", 
  1936, 0.5, "Jamie",
  1936, 0.5, "Jamie"
)
```

### Step 2H: Order the facets

```{r}
ranked_names <- most_unisex_names %>%
  mutate(
        fct_rmse = factor(rmse),
        name_rank= dense_rank(fct_rmse),
    )

ranked_names

```



```{r}
ranked_names <- most_unisex_names %>%
  inner_join(fd_names, by = c("name" = "name")) %>% 
  mutate(
        fct_rmse = factor(rmse),
        name_rank= dense_rank(fct_rmse),
         name_label = paste(fd_rank, name, sep = ". ")
    )
fd_names
ranked_names
```


### Step 2I: Draw the plot

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = pct_girls)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(fill = "#eaac9e") +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales='free_x', ncol = 7) +
  geom_point(data = unisex_years, fill = "white", pch = 21, size = 2.8) +
  geom_text(
    data = jessie_labels, 
    aes(label = label), 
    color = "white"
  ) +
  geom_text(
  data = general_context, family = "Century Gothic",
    aes(x = year_label, y = vpos, label = text, hjust = hjust), 
    vjust = "top",size=2
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, 
    limits = c(0, 1),
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    labels = scales::percent,
    expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
    geom_path(data = general_segments, aes(x = year, y = pct_girls)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1940, 1960, 1980, 2000), 
                     labels = c("1940", "'60", "'80", "2000"), 
                     expand = c(0,0),
                     NULL
                     ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#eaac9e", "black")) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#92bdd3"),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "bold", size = 14)
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(
    caption = "Source: Social Security Administration | By http://flowingdata.com"
  )
```

## Word count

```{r word_count, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
text_stats()
```

## Standards

In this assignment, we attempted the following [standards](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/standards.html):

- `r standard_button("wrangling")`: We mastered the Wrangling standard because we utilized functions such as group_by() and group_modify(), as well as mutate to optimize the code for readability and performance. 
- `r standard_button("relational")`: We mastered the Relational standard because we utilized the inner_join function to include potentially missing data and merge various data frames.
- `r standard_button("reshape")`: We mastered the Reshape standard because we transformed the various data frames with pivot functions for the lists. 
- `r standard_button("aesthetics")`: We mastered the Aesthetics standard because we customized and utilized a wide range of available geoms and color palettes, along with specific labeling of the graphic. 
- `r standard_button("markdown")`: We mastered the R Markdown standard because we employed formatting within the Markdown file to incllude a variety of code chunks, text, and graphics.
